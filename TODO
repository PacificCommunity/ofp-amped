Ideas of things to add
----------------------

1. 'Circle of doom' HCR that recreates the Majuro / Kobe circle of doom. e.g. fish at catch = Chigh until F < Fmsy, then fish at catch = Clow until F > Fmsy, and so on.
2. More exercises for Measuring Performance to explore how PIs can be used to compare HCRs and trade-offs. e.g. run pairs of different HCRs and look at catch vs catch stability, catch vs CPUE etc.
3. Reduce number of PIs in Introduction to Uncertainty (no effort or CPUE variability)
4. Update link to Source on Information page
5. Fix catch history (under-, over-exploited) and life history.
6. Random seed setter?
7. Add link to tutorials (hosted somewhere or HTML versions in tutorials folder)
