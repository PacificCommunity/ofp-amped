### Box plots

Box plots show the range of values the indicator, in each time period (short-, medium- and long-term).
This means they are able present some information on the uncertainty of that indicator.

The box contains the 20-80 percentiles, the whiskers, show the 5-95 percentiles, and the horizontal line is average (median) value.
Note that the average value will be the same as the value shown in the bar charts.

The bigger the box, and the longer the whiskers, the greater the range of values of the indicator, and the less certain we are about its value.
It is generally preferred to have low uncertainty, so the smaller the box the be better.
