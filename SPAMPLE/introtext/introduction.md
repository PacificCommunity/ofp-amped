## What is SPAMPLE?

SPAMPLE is a tool for exploring and comparing the performance of alternative candidate Management Procedures (MPs) of south Pacific albacore.

A Management Procedure has three components:

1. Data collection
2. Estimation model (empirical data)
3. Harvest Control Rule (HCR)

For the current set of results, the data collection are the same for each MP. The empirical data (observed CPUE for HCR1 to HCR6; observed mean length in cathc for HCR7 to HCR9) and the HCRs are different.
This means that we are comparing the performance of HCRs with the aim of selecting one that is most likely to meet your management objectives.

The performance of each HCR is measured using different performance indicators (PIs).
SPAMPLE can be used to explore and compare the PIs in a number of ways, using different plots and tables.
This allows trade-offs between the different HCRs to be evaluated.

The focus should be on the *relative* performance of the different MPs, e.g. MP X results in higher catches than MP Y.

## How to use SPAMPLE

The main purpose of SPAMPLE is to compare the relative performance of  South Pacific albacore HCRs. This is most easily done using the **Compare performance** tab at the top of the screen.
This tab allows you to view the indicators using different plot types (see below).

To aid investigation it is possible to select the indicators that are of most interest, and deselect those that are of less interest.
Similarly, it is possible to select and deselect HCRs to focus attention on a smaller subset.

A more detailed investigation of the indicators can be found under the **Explore indicators** tab at the top.
This allows you to see the indicators in more detail, for example viewing the catch based indicators by model area.

## Model Areas

The model used for the evaluations has five areas as seen here:

## Performance Indicators

Currently there are six PIs included in SPAMPLE.
Their numbers relate to their position in the original table of indicators. These numbers have been kept for convenience.

The average values of the PIs are calculated over three time periods:

* Short-term: 2017-2026
* Medium-term: 2027-2036
* Long-term: 2037-2046

With the exception of SB/SBF=0, all of the indicators have been scaled so that 'bigger is better', i.e. the larger the value, the better the MP is thought to be performing for that PI.

Some of the indicators are calculated over different model areas, or only calculated for certain subsets of fisheries and areas.

### SB/SBF=0


SB/SBF=0 is the ratio of the adult biomass to the adult biomass in the absence of fishing (sometimes known as depletion).
The value ranges between 0 and 1.
SB/SBF=0 is a measure of stock status and can be compared to the Limit Reference Point (0.2) and the Target Reference Point (0.56, interim).

### 1. Probability of SB/SBF=0 being above the Limit Reference Point (LRP)

This indicator ranges between 0 and 1.
The higher the value, the smaller the chance of the stock falling below the LRP.
For example, a value of 1 means that there is no chance of falling below the LRP and a value of 0.9 means that there is a 1 in 10 (0.1) chance of falling below the LRP.

Higher values are preferred, depending on the level of risk that managers and stakeholders are prepared to accept.

### 3. Catches

The catches are presented as relative to the average catches in the period 2014 to 2016.
They are calculated over several groupings, based on area and fishery:

* Total catch over all areas and fisheries
* Distant-water (DWFN) total longline catches
* Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) total longline catches

### 4. Relative Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE)

The CPUE are presented as relative to the CPUE in year 2013 with 8% increase (as used as the baseline year in TRP discussions) for longline fisheries. They are calculated over several groupings, based on area and fishery:

* Total CPUE (all areas combined)
* Total DWFN CPUE (all areas combined)
* Total PICT CPUE (all areas combined)
* PICT CPUE in Area 2

### 6. Catch stability

Catch stability measures how variable catches are in time. 
The indicator ranges between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that the catches do not change over time, i.e. they are constant.
A value of 0 means that the catches vary relatively strongly over time, compared to the other HCRs.

The indicator has been calculated over the same groupings as described for PI 3 (catches).
However, note that although the stability of catches can be compared across time different periods and HCRs, it cannot be compared between area groupings. 
For example, you cannot compare the stabilities in area 1 to the stabilities in area 2.

This indicator has also been calculated as the variability of relative catches (catches relative to the average catches in the period 2014 to 2016) over time.
The higher the variability, the more the catches change over time.
A variability of 0 means that the catches are not changing over time.

### 7. Effort stability

This is similar to PI 6 (catch stability).
It measures the stability of effort relative to the effort in 2013.
It is also possible to investigate the variability, as well as the stability.

### 8. Proximity of SB/SBF=0 to the Target Reference Point (TRP)

This indicator measures how close, on average, the SB/SBF=0 was to the TRP in each year.
The higher the value of the indicator, the closer SB/SBF=0 was to the TRP in each year, on average.
A value of 1 means that the SB/SBF=0 was exactly at the TRP in each year.
A value of 0 means that the SB/SBF=0 was as far from the TRP as possible in each year.

Note that this indicator is slightly different to comparing the average value of SB/SBF=0 to the TRP.
If the average value of SB/SBF=0 over a range of years is close to the TRP it does not necessarily mean that SB/SBF=0 was close to the TRP during those years.
For example, if SB/SBF=0 moved between 0.3 and 0.7 each year, the average value would be 0.5 but it would never have been very close to 0.5 in any year.

## Plot Types

There are four plot types available in SPAMPLE: bar charts, box plots, time series plots and radar plots. Each of them displays the information in a different way.
