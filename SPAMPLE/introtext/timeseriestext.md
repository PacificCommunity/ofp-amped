### Time series plots

Time series plots show the range of values of an indicator over time.
The envelope contains the 10-90 precentiles, and so covers most of the range of values.
The dashed line in the middle shows the average (median) value.

It possible to superimpose some individual trajectories on the time series plots.
These can help given an idea of the variability in time of the indicator.

When lots of HCRs are selected, it can be difficult to tell which HCR is which.
Time series plots are therefore better used for comparing the performance of a few HCRs at a time.

Note that stability indicators (PIs 6 and 7), and the probability of SB/SBF=0 being below the LRP (PI 1) do not have time series plots.
