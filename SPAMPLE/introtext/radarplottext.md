### Radar plots

Radar plots attempt to compare the performance of HCRs across all performance indicators in a time period. A radar plot is produced for each time period.
The average (median) value of each indicator is shown on the plot which means that uncertainty, or the range of values of each indicator, is not shown. 

Radar plots can be useful for providing a quick overview of the overall performance of each HCR. However, for more a detailed inspection of the performance it may be necessary to use an alternative plot type.

Only the indicators for which 'bigger is better' are shown, meaning that SB/SBF=0 is not included (a bigger SB/SBF=0 is not necessarily better).

Radar plots can become difficult to interpret when more than two or three HCRs are compared at the same time.
